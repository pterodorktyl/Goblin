# GoblinTools
GoblinTools is an opensource hacking and network security toolkit made for the Grey Hack hacking-sim mmo.
Users should not attempt to use GoblinTools for for real-world hacking or network security.

GoblinTools aims to be useful for players of Gray Hack who are just entering a beginner's to intermediate
level of understanding with the Gray Script coding language. The scripts compiled in this project are 
open-source and intended to be upgraded at the speed of the developer's understanding.

As scripts are updated, previous versions will be kept in order to showcase the process of refactoring
old code for better performance. Once the body of this codebase is substantial enough, the development
process on a unified hacktool will begin.

All due credit to the tutors this developer has found in the Grey Hack & Pirate Software Communities.
